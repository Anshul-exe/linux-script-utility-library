# Kargos Plugins Collection

This repository contains a collection of custom plugins for [Kargos](https://github.com/lipido/kargos), a KDE Plasma port of the Argos and BitBar plugin formats, enabling easy creation of custom plasmoids. Each plugin here is designed to provide practical utilities and dynamic system information right on your KDE panel.

## Features

- **CPU Monitoring**: Displays real-time CPU usage and load with color-coded thresholds.
- **Memory Usage**: Shows available memory and usage percentage.
- **Disk Usage**: Monitors specified partitions and alerts based on usage levels.
- **Weather Updates**: Fetches current weather information using `curl` and a weather API.
- **RSS Feed Reader**: Continuously rotates through headlines from favorite RSS feeds, inspired by KNewsTicker.
- **Network Status**: Displays Wi-Fi strength, IP addresses, and network connectivity details.
- **Battery Status**: Shows current battery charge level and charging status.
- **Volume Control**: Adds quick volume adjustment and mute options.

## Plugin Examples

### CPU Monitor Plugin (`cpu-monitor.5s.sh`)
This plugin displays current CPU usage, updating every 5 seconds. It color-codes usage levels based on threshold settings:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "CPU: $(grep 'cpu ' /proc/stat | awk '{print int(($2+$4)*100/($2+$4+$5))}')% | color=blue"
```

### RSS Reader Plugin (`rss-reader.60s.sh`)
Displays headlines from an RSS feed, refreshing every 60 seconds. Useful for tracking news without switching apps.
```bash
#!/bin/bash
curl -s "https://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss" | grep "<title>" | head -n 5 | sed 's/<[^>]*>//g'
```

### Weather Plugin (`weather.30m.sh`)
Fetches and displays current weather info from an API, refreshing every 30 minutes.
```bash
#!/bin/bash
LOCATION="your-city"
API_KEY="your-api-key"
curl -s "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=$LOCATION&appid=$API_KEY" \
| jq -r '.weather[0].description + " " + (.main.temp - 273.15 | tostring) + "Â°C"'
```

## Customization

Each plugin script is easily configurable. Modify refresh intervals by renaming files (e.g., `plugin.5s.sh` to `plugin.10m.sh`). Add new functionalities by editing the `echo` statements, and change colors or icons based on your preferences.
